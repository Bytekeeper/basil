BASIL no longer supports BWAPI 4.3.0. But: BASIL now supports BWAPI 4.4.0. Thanks again Hannes Bredberg for the new release!

I believe more thorough testing went into this one. Please checkout the list of changes on [https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/releases/tag/v4.4.0](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/releases/tag/v4.4.0).
