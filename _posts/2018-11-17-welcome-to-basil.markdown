Going live of BASIL. It works "good enough" for now:
* Most bots from [SSCAIT](https://sscaitournament.com/) are supported and should run fine.
* I found at least one bot which is not working: AyyyLmao (a problem with loading the DLL in java).
* Based on [SC_DOCKER](https://github.com/Games-and-Simulations/sc-docker) (if it doesn't work out, I'll consider switching to VMs).
* Game results are available as `JSON` files in Replays&Results above.
* Replays are also obviously available there.
* Game and bot logs as well as crash logs are also available inside.
* ELO ratings for all participating bots are available.
* Bugs, misconfiguration/-calculation and crashes are plenty ðŸ˜…

If you have ideas for improvements, write me (email is all the way down here).
