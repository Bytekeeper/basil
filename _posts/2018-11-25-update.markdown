I did a major rewrite of how BASIL server was working. The previously aggregated data would be hard to integrate and was flawed anyways, so it was 'discarded'.
You can still get all previously aggregated data, it's packed in a large `bz2` file and available in Replays & Results.

Change summary:
* ELO rating calculation now should mostly match [[SSCAITs]](http://cachedsscaitscores.krasi0.com/eloRatings/) - with the exception of not using a limit of 4000 games.
* All SSCAIT maps are now used, not only `Benzene`.
* Removed `Electric Circuit` (albeit it was never used).
