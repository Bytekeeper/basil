# BASIL

This is the code used to run the BASIL ladder.

## Setup
* [SC_DOCKER](https://github.com/Games-and-Simulations/sc-docker) has to be installed (I recommend using Bruce Mackenzie Nielsen's [fork](https://github.com/bmnielsen/sc-docker) instead).
* Make sure BWTA2 cache files are present (deployment of them seems to be buggy)
* A Java Runtime has to be installed
* Checkout this repo 
* Configure `src/main/application.properties` if required
* Run `./gradlew run`
