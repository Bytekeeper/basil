BASIL is a league for AI players competing in Starcraft Broodwar. It started of as an "add-on" for [SSCAIT], where only a single game is played at a time and is streamed live!

This is great to watch but delays ranking of bots severly. BASIL does not stream live and runs multiple parallel games at maximum speed (take a look at the [stats] to see what that means).

At the time of writing, after 14 months of running, almost 600,000 games have been played. Only a portion of the replays is available online, but if you require more feel free to contact me (see below).
